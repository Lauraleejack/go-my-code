Before starting to use its APIs endpoints, it's mandatory that you generate your API KEY and store it somewhere for later use. The API key acts as the user identifier when requesting the API. To get your KEY, fill in the provided form with your personal information, and then we shall receive an email containing your personal API KEY.\n",
